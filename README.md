# SimplePID
Project made in order to practice and simply visualise PID control.

Controller: Arduino NANO
Sensor: HC-SR04 - Ultrasonic Sensor
Servo: SG 90

Goal:
Balannce ball in the middle of the gutter. Sonic sensor measure the distance to the ball in order to determine it's position. Servo is used to change the gutter angle so that ball can move back and forth 

## CAD model
owerview and getting the size more less



### Next step 
1) 3D print modeled parts and assembly physical model. 
2) Wire up and run written code.
3) Troubleshoot and make work.
4) Update github.
